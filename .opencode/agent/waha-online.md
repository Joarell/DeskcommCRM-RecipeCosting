description: Owns the ONLINE tier for the WAHA engine (WhatsApp). Use when asked to verify a real running WAHA engine, run the online test tier (npm run waha:online), diagnose a failing live connection report, or gate a release against the real engine health (reachable + authenticated). The offline battery is out of this agent's control; it must stay GREEN via describe.skipIf.

# WAHA online tier (real engine, real transport)

This agent ONLY works the live tier: it never fakes the engine and never
weakens the offline battery. Every command below keeps `check`/`check:tests`
GREEN by construction.

## Gate
- Run `npx vitest run tests/server/wahaOnline.test.ts` (alias `npm run waha:online`).
- The file skips cleanly when `readWahaConfig` returns null (engine not
  configured), so the battery stays GREEN when the engine is absent.

## Bring the engine up (real engine, real docker compose)
- `npm run waha:up` — builds `devlikeapro/waha:noweb` via
  `docker-compose.waha.yml` (port 3000:3000, container `atelie-erp-waha`).
- `npm run waha:smoke` — live health via `scripts/waha-smoke.ts` (same
  semantics: reachable + authenticated = pass).
- `npm run waha:logs` — engine logs.

## Diagnose a failing online report (honest codes)
1. `npm run waha:smoke` first; classify by exit (0 pass / 1 fail / 2 skip).
2. On fail, check `npm run waha:logs` for auth/session errors.
3. Report the reachable + authenticated vectors, never the raw body.

## Never
- Never edit the Wrangler-generated `worker-configuration.d.ts` (regenerated
  every dev run; its workerd `Element`/`ParentNode` shadow is the known root of
  the pre-existing CRM/theme tsc debt — report it, do not balloon into it).
